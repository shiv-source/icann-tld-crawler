# ICANN TLD Crawler

A high-performance Node.js-based crawler that scrapes the official [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) website to collect, normalize, and export structured **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** data in a clean, developer-friendly JSON format.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This crawler automates the extraction and formatting of public TLD records maintained by ICANN, providing structured insights into:

- 🧾 **TLD Metadata** — including name, category, and registration dates  
- 🏢 **Sponsoring Organizations** — with associated websites  
- 🔗 **Registry Services** — WHOIS, RDAP, and registration service URLs  
- 🧠 **Technical Infrastructure** — authoritative name servers and IP mappings  
- 🕒 **Timestamps** — registration and last update tracking

The output is suitable for developers, researchers, domain registrars, and security analysts.
